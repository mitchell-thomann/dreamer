# dreamer <img src='inst/hex-dreamer.png' align="right" height="139"/>

The goal of dreamer (Dose REsponse bAyesian Model avERaging) is to flexibly model (longitudinal) dose-response relationships.  This is accomplished using Bayesian model averaging of parametric dose-response models (see Gould (2019), Ando & Tsay (2010)).

dreamer supports a number of dose-response models including linear, quadratic, 
log-linear, log-quadratic, EMAX, exponential, for use as models that
can be included in the model averaging approach.  In addition, several
longitudinal models are also supported (see the vignette).  All of the above
models are available for both continuous and binary endpoints.

# Installation

dreamer is available on CRAN and can be installed with `install.packages("dreamer")`.  Note that dreamer depends on [rjags](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rjags) which
itself depends on an installation of JAGS.

The development version of dreamer can be installed directly from github: 
`devtools::install_github("rich-payne/dreamer")`.

For feature requests and to report bugs, please submit an issue to the [dreamer github](https://github.com/rich-payne/dreamer/issues).

# Vignettes

See the "dreamer_method" vignette for a high-level overview of Bayesian model averaging and/or read Gould (2019) for the approach used by dreamer.

For a larger set of examples, see the "dreamer" vignette.

# Example

With dreamer, it is easy to generate data, fit models, and visualize model
fits.

```{r example}
library(dreamer)
# generate data from a quadratic dose response
set.seed(888)
data <- dreamer_data_quad(
  n_cohorts = c(10, 10, 10, 10), # number of subjects in each cohort
  dose = c(.25, .5, .75, 1.5), # dose administered to each cohort
  b1 = 0,
  b2 = 2,
  b3 = -1,
  sigma = .5 # standard deviation
)

# Bayesian model averaging
output <- dreamer_mcmc(
  data = data,
  # mcmc information
  n_adapt = 1e3,
  n_burn = 1e3,
  n_iter = 1e4,
  n_chains = 2,
  silent = TRUE, # make rjags be quiet
  # model definitions
  mod_linear = model_linear(
    mu_b1 = 0,
    sigma_b1 = 1,
    mu_b2 = 0,
    sigma_b2 = 1,
    shape = 1,
    rate = .001,
    w_prior = 1 / 3 # prior probability of the model
  ),
  mod_quad = model_quad(
    mu_b1 = 0,
    sigma_b1 = 1,
    mu_b2 = 0,
    sigma_b2 = 1,
    mu_b3 = 0,
    sigma_b3 = 1,
    shape = 1,
    rate = .001,
    w_prior = 1 / 3
  ),
  mod_emax = model_emax(
    mu_b1 = 0,
    sigma_b1 = 1,
    mu_b2 = 0,
    sigma_b2 = 1,
    mu_b3 = 0,
    sigma_b3 = 1,
    mu_b4 = 0,
    sigma_b4 = 1,
    shape = 1,
    rate = .001,
    w_prior = 1 / 3
  )
)

output

# plot Bayesian model averaging fit
plot(output, data = data)

# plot individual model fit
plot(output$mod_emax, data = data)

# posterior summary for model parameters
summary(output)

# posterior summary on dose-response curve
posterior(output)
```
