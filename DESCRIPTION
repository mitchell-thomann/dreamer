Description: Fits (longitudinal) dose-response models utilizing a Bayesian model
  averaging approach for both continuous and binary responses.
  The Bayesian model averaging updates the weights
  similar to those in Gould 2019 <doi:10.1002/bimj.201700211>.  Functions
  for plotting and various posterior quantities (e.g. posterior mean,
  quantiles, probability of minimum efficacious dose, etc.) are also
  implemented.  Copyright Eli Lilly (2019).
